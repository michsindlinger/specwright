# Product Brief (Lite): Specwright

> Condensed version for AI context optimization
> Full version: @specwright/product/product-brief.md

## Elevator Pitch

Specwright is an open-source, spec-driven development framework that helps experienced software developers and architects in enterprise SCRUM/SAFe environments multiply their efficiency by providing structured, agentic workflows with self-learning agents and human-in-the-loop control at every critical decision point.

## Core Value

Specwright is the first agentic framework built for enterprise software development processes. It bridges the gap between Product Backlog and AI execution by providing a complete lifecycle from product planning through autonomous feature development - with the human always in control. Agents learn from every iteration, ensuring quality improves automatically over time.

## Target Users

- **Primary:** Senior Software Developers & Architects in enterprise SCRUM/SAFe teams who use AI coding assistants
- **Secondary:** Tech Leads & Engineering Managers in security-critical environments seeking structured AI adoption

## Key Features (Top 5)

1. **Spec-Driven Workflow:** 34 commands covering full lifecycle from product planning to autonomous feature execution
2. **Self-Learning Agents:** Skills auto-update Dos-and-Donts and domain knowledge after every story implementation
3. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Review documents after every process step, interactive decisions at all critical points
4. **Multi-LLM Support:** Configure providers per story (Anthropic, GLM, MiniMax, Kimi K2) - enables on-premise deployment for regulated environments
5. **Autonomous Pipeline:** Queue multiple specs, let agents work autonomously for hours, review results

## Primary Differentiator

Unlike code-completion tools (Cursor, Copilot), Specwright provides enterprise-grade SCRUM/SAFe process support with self-learning agents that improve with every iteration - multiplying developer efficiency rather than replacing developers. Works for both new and existing projects - integrate at any time with zero-friction via `/analyze-product`.

## Success Metric

**Feature Velocity:** 3-5x improvement vs. manual development, measured through user case studies

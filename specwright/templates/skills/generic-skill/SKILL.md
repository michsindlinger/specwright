**Template Usage Instructions:**

This generic template should be used when:
1. Standard skill templates don't cover the needed capability
2. Highly specialized domain knowledge required (blockchain, ML, IoT, etc.)
3. Project-specific patterns need to be captured

**Customization:**
- Replace all [PLACEHOLDERS] with actual content
- Fill [TECH_STACK_SPECIFIC] with relevant framework patterns
- Add domain-specific examples
- Specify relevant tools and integrations

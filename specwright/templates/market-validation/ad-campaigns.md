## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Google Ads Issues

**Issue**: Ads not approved
- **Cause**: Policy violation (exaggerated claims, prohibited content)
- **Fix**: Review policy, rewrite ad, resubmit

**Issue**: Low impressions
- **Cause**: Keywords too specific, bids too low, low budget
- **Fix**: Add more keywords, increase bid, increase budget

**Issue**: High CTR but no conversions
- **Cause**: Ad promise doesn't match landing page
- **Fix**: Align ad copy with landing page headline

**Issue**: High CPA (>€20)
- **Cause**: Broad targeting, wrong audience, competitive keywords
- **Fix**: Add negative keywords, narrow targeting, focus on long-tail keywords

### Facebook Ads Issues

**Issue**: Low reach
- **Cause**: Audience too narrow, budget too low
- **Fix**: Broaden interests, increase budget

**Issue**: Ads rejected
- **Cause**: Too much text in image (>20% rule removed but still penalized), prohibited content
- **Fix**: Reduce text overlay, check ad policies

**Issue**: High frequency (>3)
- **Cause**: Showing same ad too many times to same people (ad fatigue)
- **Fix**: Expand audience, create new ad variants, pause campaign temporarily

**Issue**: Low CTR (<0.5%)
- **Cause**: Ad not compelling, wrong audience
- **Fix**: Rewrite hook, test visual (before/after, benefit-driven)

## Primary Validation Criteria

### Criterion 1: Conversion Rate

**Formula**: Email Signups ÷ Total Visitors × 100%

**Target**: ≥ [X]% (e.g., ≥5%)

**Actual Result**: [Y]%

**Calculation**:
```
Email Signups: [#]
Total Visitors: [#]
Conversion Rate: [#] ÷ [#] × 100% = [Y]%
```

**Status**: [✅ Exceeded / ⚠️ Close / ❌ Below Target]

**Confidence Interval** (95%):
- Lower Bound: [%]
- Upper Bound: [%]
- Interpretation: [e.g., "95% confident true conversion is between 4.7% and 7.7%"]

**Sample Size Adequacy**:
- Visitors: [#]
- Minimum Required: ~1,000 for 5% conversion
- Status: [✅ Adequate / ❌ Insufficient]

**Benchmarking**:
- Industry Average (SaaS): 2-5%
- Good Performance: 5-10%
- Our Result: [Y]% ([Below/At/Above] industry average)

---

### Criterion 2: Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

**Formula**: Total Ad Spend ÷ Total Conversions

**Target**: ≤ €[X] (e.g., ≤€10)

**Actual Result**: €[Y]

**Calculation**:
```
Total Ad Spend: €[A]
Total Conversions: [B]
CPA: €[A] ÷ [B] = €[Y]
```

**Status**: [✅ Below Target / ⚠️ Close / ❌ Above Target]

**Comparison to LTV** (if known):
```
Estimated LTV: €[X] (from ARPU × lifespan projections)
CPA: €[Y]
LTV:CAC Ratio: [X] ÷ [Y] = [Z]:1

Evaluation:
- >3:1 = ✅ Excellent (highly profitable)
- 2-3:1 = ⚠️ Good (profitable)
- 1-2:1 = ⚠️ Marginal (barely profitable)
- <1:1 = ❌ Unprofitable (losing money)

Our Ratio: [Z]:1 → [Excellent/Good/Marginal/Unprofitable]
```

**CPA by Channel**:
```
Google Search: €[X] ([Best/Worst])
Facebook Feed: €[Y]
Instagram: €[Z]

→ Recommendation for full launch: Focus on [best channel]
```

---

### Criterion 3: Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Target**: ≥ [X] users (e.g., ≥100,000)

**Actual Estimate**: [Y] users

**Calculation Method**: [Top-down / Bottom-up / Both]

**Top-Down Estimation**:
```
Step 1: Total [target population] in [region]: [#]
Step 2: Subset with [qualifying characteristic]: [#] ([%])
Step 3: Subset with [pain point]: [#] ([%])
Step 4: Willing to pay for solution: [#] ([%])

TAM: [FINAL NUMBER] users
```

**Example**:
```
Step 1: Freelancers in Germany: 1,500,000
Step 2: Tech-savvy (use digital tools): 600,000 (40%)
Step 3: Have invoicing pain: 300,000 (50% of tech-savvy)
Step 4: Willing to pay €5/month: 150,000 (50%)

TAM: 150,000 users
```

**Bottom-Up Validation** (from campaign data):
```
Conversion Rate: [%]
If reached 10% of TAM with same conversion: [#] conversions
Required ad spend: [#] ÷ [CPA] = €[X]
Feasibility: [Realistic / Unrealistic]
```

**Status**: [✅ Exceeds / ⚠️ Close / ❌ Below Target]

**Market Size Assessment**:
- 1M+: Large market (multiple products can succeed)
- 100k-1M: Medium market (1-2 dominant players)
- 10k-100k: Niche market (specialized product)
- <10k: Too small (unless very high-price product)

**Our Market**: [SIZE] → [Large/Medium/Niche/Too Small]

```

---

## GO Decision Path

**If Decision = GO**, proceed with:

### Product Development Recommendations

**Focus Areas** (based on validation data):
1. **Target Audience**: [Most responsive segment - e.g., "Freelance designers ages 30-40 in urban Germany"]
2. **Core Features**: [Must-have features based on feedback]
3. **Messaging**: [Winning headlines and value props from ads]
4. **Pricing**: [Validated price point - e.g., "€5/month confirmed, 89% said it's 'affordable'"]

**Feature Prioritization** (informed by qualitative feedback):
```
MVP (Must Have):
- [Feature 1 from original product brief]
- [Feature 2 from original product brief]
- [Feature 3 from original product brief]

v1.1 (Should Have):
- [Top requested feature from feedback]
- [Second most requested]

v2.0 (Could Have):
- [Nice-to-have features]
```

### Market Entry Strategy

**Launch Approach**: [Soft launch / Niche-first / Broad launch]

**Rationale**: [Why this approach based on validation data]

**Example**:
```
Approach: Niche-first (Freelance Designers Only)

Rationale:
- Designers showed 2x higher conversion than general freelancers (8% vs. 4%)
- Design community is tight-knit (word-of-mouth potential)
- Easier to saturate niche, build testimonials, then expand
```

**Primary Marketing Channel**: [Best performing channel from validation]

**Budget Recommendation**: [Based on CPA and LTV]

**Example**:
```
Primary Channel: Google Search (€6 CPA, 8% conversion)
Budget: €2,000/month → 333 conversions/month
→ 4,000 users in year 1
→ Revenue: 4,000 × €60 (annual) = €240k ARR
```

### Product Refinements

**Based on Feedback**, consider:
1. [Refinement 1 - e.g., "Emphasize 'no accounting knowledge' (mentioned 18 times)"]
2. [Refinement 2 - e.g., "Add expense tracking to roadmap (8 requests)"]
3. [Refinement 3 - e.g., "Create 'Simple Mode' vs. 'Advanced Mode' (5 users wanted more features)"]

---

## MAYBE Decision Path

**If Decision = MAYBE**, recommended actions:

### Why MAYBE?

**Criteria Status**:
- Conversion Rate: [✅ Met / ❌ Not Met] ([X]% actual vs. [Y]% target)
- CPA: [✅ Met / ❌ Not Met] (€[X] actual vs. €[Y] target)
- TAM: [✅ Met / ❌ Not Met] ([X] actual vs. [Y] target)

**Gap Analysis**:
[Which criteria didn't meet and by how much]

**Example**:
```
Conversion Rate: ❌ Not Met (3.5% vs. 5% target, -30% gap)
CPA: ✅ Met (€8 vs. €10 target)
TAM: ✅ Met (200k vs. 100k target)

→ MAYBE because conversion rate slightly below target, but CPA and TAM are strong
```

### Improvement Strategies

**To Improve Conversion Rate**:
- [ ] Test 5 new headlines (more benefit-driven, specific)
- [ ] Simplify landing page (remove distractions)
- [ ] Add more social proof (testimonials, user count)
- [ ] Reduce form fields (email only)
- [ ] Add trust signals (security badge, guarantee)

**To Improve CPA**:
- [ ] Narrow targeting (focus on best-converting segment)
- [ ] Pause low-performing ads (bottom 50%)
- [ ] Optimize ad copy (test pain-focused angle)
- [ ] Add negative keywords (exclude irrelevant traffic)
- [ ] Lower bids (if using manual bidding)

**To Improve TAM**:
- [ ] Expand target market definition
- [ ] Research adjacent segments
- [ ] Validate TAM estimate with additional sources

### Re-Test Plan

**Changes to Make**:
1. [Change 1 based on gaps]
2. [Change 2]
3. [Change 3]

**Budget**: €[X] (smaller than initial test)

**Duration**: [X] weeks

**Success Criteria** (adjusted):
- Conversion Rate: ≥ [X]% (may lower slightly)
- CPA: ≤ €[Y]
- TAM: ≥ [Z]

**If Re-Test Also MAYBE**: Consider pivot or reduce scope

---

## NO-GO Decision Path

**If Decision = NO-GO**, consider:

### Why NO-GO?

**Criteria Status**:
- Conversion Rate: [X]% (Target: [Y]%, Gap: -[Z]%)
- CPA: €[X] (Target: €[Y], Gap: +€[Z])
- TAM: [X] (Target: [Y], Gap: -[Z])

**Critical Issues**:
- [Issue 1 - e.g., "Conversion rate only 1.5%, indicating very low interest"]
- [Issue 2 - e.g., "CPA of €25 is unsustainable (3x target)"]
- [Issue 3 - e.g., "TAM only 30k, too small for viable business"]

### Learnings

**What We Learned**:
1. [Learning 1 - e.g., "Market is too crowded, users don't see enough differentiation"]
2. [Learning 2 - e.g., "Price sensitivity higher than expected, €5 still seen as 'too expensive'"]
3. [Learning 3 - e.g., "Users want simpler problem - not full invoicing, just payment reminders"]

**What Didn't Work**:
- [What failed 1]
- [What failed 2]

**What Worked** (bright spots):
- [What succeeded 1 - e.g., "Headline 'Save 5 Hours Per Week' had 3x CTR of others"]
- [What succeeded 2]

### Alternative Approaches

**Pivot Option 1: [Alternative]**
- **Change**: [What to change - e.g., "Focus on payment reminders only, not full invoicing"]
- **Rationale**: [Why - e.g., "15 users mentioned 'just want to remember to invoice, don't need features'"]
- **Validation**: [How to test - e.g., "Re-run validation with new positioning"]

**Pivot Option 2: [Alternative]**
- **Change**: [What to change]
- **Rationale**: [Why]
- **Validation**: [How to test]

**Abandon Option**:
- **When to Abandon**: [If no viable pivot, or pivots also fail]
- **Lessons to Carry Forward**: [What you learned for next idea]

## Financial Projection (If GO)

### Revenue Potential

**Conservative Estimate** (based on validation data):
```
Year 1 Customer Acquisition:
- Monthly ad budget: €[X]
- CPA: €[Y] (from validation)
- Customers/month: [X] ÷ [Y] = [Z]
- Year 1 total: [Z] × 12 = [W] customers

Year 1 Revenue:
- Customers: [W]
- ARPU: €[X]/year
- Gross Revenue: [W] × [X] = €[Y]

Year 1 Costs:
- Marketing: €[X] × 12 = €[Y]
- Development: €[Z]
- Operations: €[W]
- Total Costs: €[SUM]

Year 1 Net: €[Revenue] - €[Costs] = €[Net] ([Profit/Loss])
```

**Example**:
```
Monthly Budget: €2,000
CPA: €8 (validated)
Customers/month: €2,000 ÷ €8 = 250
Year 1 Total: 3,000 customers (accounting for churn)

Revenue: 3,000 × €60 = €180,000
Costs: €40,000 (marketing, dev, operations)
Net: €140,000 profit (Year 1)

ROI: €140k ÷ €40k = 350% return
```

### Break-Even Analysis

**Break-Even Point**:
```
Fixed Costs: €[X]/year
ARPU: €[Y]/year
Variable Cost per Customer: €[Z]/year

Break-Even Customers: [X] ÷ ([Y] - [Z]) = [#] customers

Time to Break-Even:
At [#] customers/month: [#] ÷ [#] = [X] months
```
